## **Project Description**  

A **full-featured Todo App** built with **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **EJS templates**, designed for users to efficiently manage tasks in a **clean, modern, and responsive interface**.  

This application allows users to:  
- **Add tasks** with a title and detailed description.  
- **Update tasks** to modify existing information.  
- **Delete tasks** safely with a confirmation step.  
- **View timestamps** for creation and last update of each task.  

The frontend is built with **EJS templates and modern CSS**, including **gradients, shadows, and hover effects** for an engaging user experience. It is fully **responsive**, ensuring usability across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.  

The backend leverages **Node.js and Express.js** for handling routes and API logic, while **MongoDB** (via Mongoose) provides a robust, scalable database for storing task data. Optional integration with **Moment.js** allows for elegant date formatting throughout the app.  

This Todo App serves as a great foundation for learning **full-stack web development**, combining **backend, database, and frontend technologies** in a single, functional project.
